I intend to do whatever can be done in bash/shell scripts, supplemented by python, C, erlang, for things that are obviously easier for me in certain languages (pattern matching, big integers -> erlang, graphs -> python, C -> horrible globals, and so on)

Language per day
================
1) shell script  (and a later solution in erlang)
2) shell script
3) python (and also later done with shell script)
4) shell script
5) Erlang (and a one-liner in bash after I woke up and realize what the algorithm actually was :-))
