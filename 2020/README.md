I will use languages in this order of preference: bash scripts (with support from cli utilities), python, C, erlang, with adjustments for things that are obviously easier for me in certain languages (pattern matching, big integers -> erlang, graphs -> python, C -> horrible globals, and so on)

Language per day
================
1: bash scripts
