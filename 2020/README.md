Language per day
================
1) shell script  (and a later solution in erlang)
2) shell script
3) python (and also later done with shell script)
4) shell script
5) Erlang (and a one-liner in bash after I woke up and realize what the algorithm actually was :-))
6) shell script
7) python (and shell. Easier for #1, a bit more complex for #2)
8) bash
9) python
10) bash (part 1), python (part 2)
11) C 
12) (mostly) awk
13) shell
14) python supported by shell
15) erlang, because S-tefan didn't get it right, and python to check the erlang solution
16) python + awk + bash
17) python
18) C (bison/lex - based on the bison calculator example). combined with a shell script to sum using dc.  
19) part 1 - script, part 2 - script with grammar generator for antlr (which also solves part 1)
20) python + shell (probably the ugliest solution this year...)
21) shell (augmented with two simple python scripts). Also, requires the espresso boolean minimizer command line tool from pyeda
22) erlang
23) erlang
24) python
