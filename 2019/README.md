# AOC2019

My goal is to do the majority of the tasks in Erlang to learn Erlang. I've written less than 100 LOC erlang before this.

Not using Erlang:
* Day 6 was done in Python, I was travelling and didn't have access to an Erlang environment
* Plotting for a few of the tasks have been done in Python
* Day 15 task 2 was done in C. I got tired of coding and the solution was obvious. 
* Day 18 - python. was probably marginally easier. abusing globals
* Day 20 - reusing the code from day 18

Need "cecho" https://github.com/mazenharake/cecho for graphics, in those parts that use graphics. This lib need to be located in parallel to this repo. (However, the include paths are wrong at the moment due to the move to a 2019 subdir)
