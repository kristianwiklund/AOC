# AOC2019

My goal is to do the majority of the tasks in Erlang.

Not using Erlang:
* Day 6 was done in Python, I was travelling and didn't have access to an Erlang environment
* Plotting for a few of the tasks have been done in Python
* Day 15 task 2 was done in C. I got tired of coding and the solution was obvious. 
* Day 18 - python. was probably marginally easie. abusing globals
