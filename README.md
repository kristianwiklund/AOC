# AOC
advent of code super-repo

My AOC coding style is "ugly, using as many available libraries as possible" - which means that I tend to abuse things such as networkx, python "eval", etc.
I like writing code generators - if the problem can be solved by a long series of sed:s to generate code - it is likely that I will solve it that way. This doesn't mean that a sane programmer should do it that way (or that I would write production code that way... in case anyone wonders).


See the README for each year for details on language etc. - If nothing is stated, the problem was solved using python.

This file was mostly created to stop github from complaining that it is missing.
